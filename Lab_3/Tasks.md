Task 1: Declare an array of 10 integers and initialize it with the first 10 natural numbers.

Task 2: Write a program to search for a specific number in an array of 10 integers, If found, display its indes erwise, show a message indicating that the number was not found.

Task 3: Implement a program that inserts a new element into an array at a specific index provided by the uner

 Task 4:Write a program to delete an element at a specific index and shift the remaining elements to fill the gap.

Task 5:Assume you have a static array of 6 integer values. User will provide 6 integer values for this array, your program should check whether the values in array represent a palindrome or not. For example a value 123321 is a palindrome value, but a value 123421 is not a palindrome.

Task 6:You are required to design a program which should allow creation of a dynamic array. User should provide the size of array as input which should be in range of 1 to 20, when program is executed. Further user will provide input for elements of array. For each element value to be given as input should be in range of 0 to 12. Your program should calculate and display average of all elements of this array. Further program should calculate and display the factorial of each element of this array.

Task 7:Write a program which should implement linear search algorithm for a dynamic array, whose size is to be defined at program execution time. Program should take size of array, values of elements of array and key value as input from user. Program should check if key value is found in array using linear search. If value is found File program should display its location in array otherwise program should display a message that value is not found.

Task 8:Implement a program to search for a specific value in a 4x4 matrix. If found, display its row and column index.

Task 9
Write a program to transpose a 3x3 matrix (i.e., swap rows with columns).
